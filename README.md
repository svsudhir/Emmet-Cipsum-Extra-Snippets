#Emmet plugin extras for Web developers

Cipsum.js - Provides Corporate jargon words for use as filler text. Usage - type cipsum20 and hit Tab or expand abbreviation from Emmet menu to get 20 random corporate jargon words.

snippets-extra.json - Provides short-cuts for colorscheme generated color styles. Primary, Secondary A, Secondary B and Complimentary.  View this file to see available snippets. It is self-explanatory.

I use Susy Grid, so some additional snippets related to Susy Mixins are also available in this file.
